> For the past several years I've worked and grown with the TMW Center for Early Learning + Public health. I started out there as a research assistant, visiting participants and going through introductions and onboarding paperwork with them. I then moved into a role as head of transcription for a short while before settling in my current position as Data Coordinator. In my current position I work with large volumes of data in varying levels of structure to clean, organize, and analyze it to provide iterative feedback to the intervention design teams at the Center.
